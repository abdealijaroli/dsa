## Hi, I'm learning DSA :D
Personally, it's essential to keep a track of all the problems I've solved on Data Structures and Algorithms. This repo will sync and preserve all of my submitted solutions on LeetCode.

So, how am I syncing all my solutions from Leetcode to my repo? 
I've been using this super cool extension https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub

Alright, I'm off to solve the two-sum problem, bye ;D
